# Project 1 : CALCULATOR

A simple calculator is a basic application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically features a user-friendly interface where users
can input numbers and select operations, displaying the results in real-time.


# Project 2 : Password Generator

A password generator is a tool that creates strong, random passwords to enhance security. Users can
specify criteria such as password length and the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
numbers, and special characters. The generated passwords are typically complex and difficult to guess,
helping to protect user accounts and sensitive information.
